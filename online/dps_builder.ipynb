    "##DROPPS Builder v0.3.1: Build liquid-liquid phase seperation simulation using DROPPS\n",
    "\n",
    "[DROPPS](https://dropps.online) (Distributed Rapid Operation Platform for Phase-separation Simulations) is a unified, GROMACS-style workflow platform for performing large-scale coarse-grained (CG) simulations of biomolecular liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS). The system was designed to solve long-standing issues in the LLPS simulation community, including workflow fragmentation, force-field inconsistencies, and a lack of standardized tooling for multichain CG modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "DROPPS integrates [OpenMM](https://openmm.org), [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/), custom high-efficiency IO layers, a modular force-field engine, and a GROMACS-inspired command-line interface (“dps”). Its goal is to make CG LLPS simulations as easy and reproducible as running a typical GROMACS simulation — but with significantly greater flexibility and model extensibility."
